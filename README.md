# Kubernetes Tutorial

Kubernetes (K8S) is a standard for deployment of the containerized applications into production. K8S is an open-source => it is free to use.

## What Is Kubernetes

K8S is a container orchestration system. K8S lets you create the containers on different servers, either physical or virtual. All of that is done automatically without your intevention. We just need to say to K8S how many containers we want to create based on specific image.

K8S takes care of:

- Automatic deployment of the containerized applications across different servers
- Distribution of the load across multiple servers
